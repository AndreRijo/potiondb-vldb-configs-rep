## Testing configurations repository for PotionDB's VLDB submission

If you crossed upon here randomly, you will probably want to check these repositories first:

- [PotionDB](https://github.com/AndreRijo/potionDB/tree/remoteOp)
- [PotionDB's TPCH Client](https://github.com/AndreRijo/TPCH-Client)
- [TPCH Locality Tool](https://github.com/AndreRijo/TPCH-LocalityTool)
- [DockerManager](https://github.com/AndreRijo/DockerManager)

This repository acts as the storage for all of the configurations used to evaluate PotionDB during the production of our VLDB submission.
It contains configuration files both for PotionDB, TPC-H Client and DockerManager.
